            Rural women face significant barriers in accessing career and hobby
            guidance and counselling services.

          <p>
            Existing resources on the internet lack cohesion and are often not
            tailored to address the unique challenges these women encounter,
            including limited education, minimal exposure, and family
            restrictions. Traditional counselling services often overlook these
            specific barriers, leaving a gap in support for personal and
            professional development.

        <p>
          In-depth primary interviews were conducted as an essential part of the
          research process. Engaging directly with rural women allowed for a
          deeper understanding of their aspirations, challenges, and preferences
          regarding career and hobby guidance. These one-on-one interviews were
          crucial in uncovering nuanced insights that shaped the development of
          the counselling website. Each interview was thoughtfully structured to
          foster open dialogue, allowing participants to share their unique
          stories, experiences, and perspectives.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="mb-12">
          In conducting primary interviews with rural women for the development
          of a counselling website, a combination of audio recordings, note
          taking, and a structured questionnaire were employed. Audio recordings
          captured the richness of participants' responses, enhancing the
          analysis by preserving nuances in tone and emotion. Simultaneous
          note-taking documented non-verbal cues and observations, providing
          additional context for a comprehensive dataset. A structured
          questionnaire served as a guide, ensuring consistency across
          interviews while allowing flexibility for organic conversations.
          Together, these methods and tools facilitated a deep understanding of
          rural women's aspirations and challenges, forming the essential
          groundwork for crafting a responsive and tailored counselling website.

        <p className="my-6">
          the solution is to design a career counselling website tailored to
          women from rural backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p className="my-6">
          A website platform offers cost-effectiveness and broad reach for
          career counselling among rural women in a large country, eliminating
          geographical barriers. It provides an accessible, centralised resource

        <p className="my-6">
          In-person sessions, calls, or pamphlets for career counselling are
          often impractical on a larger scale for rural women due to logistical

          it a more viable and impactful option for reaching a diverse audience
