          Small business owners who work solo or in smaller groups, often do not
    have a dedicated team for handling their finances. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Thus, business owners are burdened by managing, tracking and
analysing their financial details, (along with the primary tasks of
manufacturing, packaging, shipping, social media advertising, etc)
causing missed opportunities for growth due to lack of proper tailored
financial insights.

improvement underscores a commitment to user-centric design, continually refining elements to enhance usability and
